# Mesh Circle

![Mesh Circle](meshCircle.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

- Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
- Open the project folder in a terminal:

        npm install              # fetches dependencies
        npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

- The application is available at *http://localhost:8080* in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example shows visualization of intensity in circle-based mesh chart

Heatmaps can be created in XY Charts:
```javascript
// Add meshCircle Series to a XY Chart
chartXY.addHeatmapSeries( {
    rows:       verticalResolution,
    columns:    horizontalResolution,
    start:      { x: 0, y: 0 },
    end:        { x: 50, y: 50 },
    pixelate:   false,
    // Make sure we're using the Mesh IntensitySeriesType
    type:       IntensitySeriesTypes.Mesh
})
```

The *Mesh IntensitySeriesType* has the same API that is available with the *Grid IntensitySeriesType*, but in addition it has the *invalidateGeometryOnly* method:

```javascript
// Use invalidateGeometryOnly to edit the geometry of the meshSircle and invalidate it.
// This can be done by supplying a Matrix of Points to the method.
meshCircle.invalidateGeometryOnly( vertices )
// Optionally, the geometry can be modified by supplying the method with a callback
// which modifies each point.
meshCircle.invalidateGeometryOnly( (row, column, current) => ({x: row, y: column}) )

// adding values for mesh is done using  invalidateValuesOnly
meshCircle.invalidateValuesOnly( values )

// coloring is done using the Palette
const lut = new LUT({
    steps: [
        { value: 0, color: ColorRGBA(0, 0, 0, 0) }, // transparent at value 0
        { value: 50, color: ColorRGBA(255, 255, 0) }, // yellow at value 50
        { value: 100, color: ColorRGBA(255, 0, 0) } // red at value 100
    ],
    interpolate: true
})
const paletteFill = new PalettedFill({ lut, lookUpProperty: 'x' })
```
